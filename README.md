# Admin Dashboard Project

I completed the Admin Dashboard project as part of The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS course. The primary objective was to build a comprehensive dashboard design using HTML and CSS, with a strong emphasis on utilizing CSS Grid for layout structuring. The project involved setting up the basic HTML structure, applying grid properties to organize the layout, and progressively nesting child elements within the main sections such as the sidebar, header, and main content areas. The goal was to create a functional and visually appealing dashboard interface.

Throughout this project, I focused on refining my CSS Grid skills and incorporating various assets such as icons, fonts, and color palettes to enhance the design. I utilized resources like Material Design Icons for SVGs and Google Fonts for typography to achieve a professional look. By applying background colors and borders, I ensured precise visualization of the grid layout. This project served as an excellent opportunity to practice and hone my front-end development skills, culminating in a responsive and well-structured admin dashboard deployed via Netlify.
